**Overview**

This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple regression models to predict a target variable using various features. Through feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, we identified the most effective model for accurate predictions.

**Key Features**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
1. Conducted thorough EDA to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
2. Performed manual feature selection to identify relevant features and their correlations.

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. Applied one-hot encoding and label encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical formats.
2. Checked for key assumptions such as multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity to ensure model reliability.

**Model Evaluation:**
1. Evaluated multiple regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Decision Tree Regressor.
2. Achieved the best performance using the Random Forest model.

**Performance Metrics:**

**Random Forest Model:**

RÂ²: 0.85

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.96

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.42

**Tools and Libraries**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy

Modeling: Scikit-learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Results**
The project demonstrates the power of feature selection and the Random Forest model in making accurate predictions, with impressive performance metrics. The model can be used in real-world applications for precise predictive analysis.
